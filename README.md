A couple of quick experiments in p5.js, exploring recursion and fractals.

Inspired by Daniel Shiffman, especially his [Fractal Tree](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/challenges/CC_14_FractalTree)

## Koch Curve
This draws a basic Koch Curve, with the number of iterations incremented when the up arrow is pressed:

## The "Not-a Dragon Curve"
In an unfruitful attempt to draw the famous Dragon Curve, I got a result that looks pretty cool. I might come back to the Dragon Curve, but enjoy this in the meantime. Again, the number of iterations increments with the up arrow:
